    "Use JupyterLab to launch a terminal and use the terminal to do the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new directory called `resume` within your home directory\n",
    "2. Create an empty file within this directory called `Readme.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use JupyterLab to edit the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the directory in the file browser\n",
    "1. Open `Readme.md` in the text editor\n",
    "1. Open `Readme.md` in in Markdown Preview\n",
    "1. Arrange these files side-by-side so you can see your document rendered\n",
    "1. Edit the file in the editor. Add the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Top level heading with your name\n",
    "    1. An image. It can be a photo of you or, if you prefer, a photo of your spirit animal.\n",
    "    1. Secondary heading entitled \"Education\"\n",
    "    1. A list of schools you attended, hyperlinked to the websites of those insitutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save the file\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now go back to the terminal and do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a new git repository in the `resume` directory\n",
    "1. Add the `Readme.md` file to the repository\n",
    "1. Create a new commit with a commit message\n",
    "1. Check the git log to see your commit history\n",
    "1. Go to github and create a [new public repository](https://github.com/new) entitled `resume`\n",
    "1. Push your local resume repository to GitHub following the instructions.\n",
    "1. View your online resume at `http://github.com/<your github username>/resume`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, go back to the editor and add a new subsection called \"Research Interests\" to your `Readme.md` file. Update your local git repository and push your changes to GitHub. Verify that the remote repository is updated.\n",

    "To \"hand in\" this part of the assignment, just provide the link to your repository in the notebook cell below.\n",

    "        cp examples/content/Assignments/assignment_1.ipynb rces-assignments/\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Initialize a new git repository \n",
    "- Add the file and make your first commit\n",
    "- Create a new **private** repository on GitHub called `rces-assignments`. (Call it exactly like that. Do not vary the spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.)\n",
    "- Push your `rces-assignments` repository to github\n",
    "- On github, go to \"settings\" -> \"collaborators\" and add `rabernat` and `xjin49`\n",
    "- Push new commits to this repository whenever you are ready to hand in your assignments"
