    "# Assignment: Calculate wet bulb temperature for CMIP6 models\n",
    "\n",
    "Global temperatures are increasing due to the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This has many potentially disastrous consequences for many people around the world. One of the concerns is that in hot and humid climates, depending on the humidity and increase in temperature could lead to fatal conditions. \n",
    "One way to quantify the combined effect of temperature and humidity for human health is the wet bulb temperature (WBT), which can be approximated as:\n",

Simply put, if the wet bulb temperature gets too high, the evaporation of sweat can not cool the human body sufficiently. \n",

    "A sustained wet bulb temperature >35C is likely to be fatal, but lower WBT can also be dangerous depending on other external factors (e.g. solar radiation and insufficient air flow). From [Raymond et al. 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7209987/): \"for example, regions affected by the deadly 2003 European and 2010 Russian heat waves experienced TW values no greater than 28Â°C\"\n",
