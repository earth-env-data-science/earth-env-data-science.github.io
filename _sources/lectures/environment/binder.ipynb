    "# Binder for Reproducible Research\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is concerned with the topic of reproducibility.\n",
    "Nearly everyone agrees that reproducibility is an important principle for science:\n",
    "if results are not reproducible, they are not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we achieve reproducibility in practice?\n",
    "In computational / data science, a particular analysis, calculation, or notebook may depend on hundreds of different software packages, each with many different versions.\n",
    "Reproducibility of our results depends on having the correct version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [lesson on python environments]({filename}/Lectures/python_environments.md), we learned how to use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to manage the packages in our environment.\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn how to package our own code / notebooks together with an environment in such a way that it can be executed by anyone / anywhere, using cloud computing.\n",

    "> Binder allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by [BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud. One-such deployment lives ... at mybinder.org and is free to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "BinderHub uses a combination of open source technologies, including JupyterHub and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) (a containerization service), to achieve this magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the <http://mybinder.org> deployment, the Pangeo project operates a BinderHub service at <http://binder.pangeo.io>. This BinderHub is customized to allow users to also launch Dask clusters in the cloud.\n"

    "## An Example Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "All binders start with a github repository. As an example, let's consider the the official dask examples repo: <https://github.com/dask/dask-examples>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository should contain the following two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python code and / or notebooks (these can live in sub-directories)\n",
    "- An `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` file to specify the package dependencies (can be at the top level or in a subdirectory called `binder/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dask-examples repo contains about 10 different example notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the environment, the dask-example repo has the following file at `binder/environment.yml`\n",

    "## nbgitpuller tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "The original binder model kept both the code itself and the environment specification in the same repo.\n",
    "The way binder works means that _every time the repo is updated, the environment must be completely rebuilt from scratch._\n",
    "As we have seen, building a complex python environment can take upwards of 20 minutes. \n",
    "So even if you only change a comment in your code, the entire environment is rebuilt when you try to relaunch the binder.\n",
    "Users usually update their code much more frequently than they update the environment.\n",
    "Furthermore, many binders may want to share the _same_ base environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, we can leverage a clever tool called [nbgitpuller](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/).\n",
    "Nbgitpuller is a JupyterHub extension that allows you to automatically launch content from a github repo into a specific\n",

    "Ok, maybe not a \"simple\" URL. ðŸ˜¬ In fact, constructing these links can be so tricky that nbgitpuller has a [special webpage](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link.html) to help you generate them.\n",
